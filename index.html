		<p>Are you currently tracking student's attendance in a Microsoft Excel Workbook or even 
			worse manually with pen and paper? <p>Every school year, public and
			private institutions have to ensure children are enrolled in a school
			system. Throughout the school year the staff have to provide attendace
			records and account for the students. Unfortunately, a student may not
			attend school on a regular basis and this must be tracked accordingly.
			The goal is to have a 100% attendance rate but that is not realistic.
			With our services, the institutions will be able to easily maintain		
			their attendace records and ultimately increase their respective
			attendance rate by identify a  correlation between the decline in a
			student's attendace and their behavior or home-life and provide
			assistance where needed.</p>
